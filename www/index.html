 _______________________Welcome To WebDevil:.
|                                                                   |
|  Welcome to the WebDevil, the decentralized webserver system.     |
| You're probably wondering, "what is WebDevil?". WebDevil is       |
| essentially what you make it. The development team for it,        |
| is anyone who downloads WebDevil and `commits` a contribution.    |
| From the start, WebDevil aims to provide simple, fast, and        |
| flexible webservices to anyone that has the need and desire       |
| to host their ideas and personal effects on our internets. It     |
| is easy enough for anyone to run and maintain, but simple and     |
| powerful enough to attract developers from all spectrums. It      |
| starts off with legible code and injects itself into the market   |
| and becomes everyones project. Fork while Fork, as more WebDevils |
| are redistributed, so are the patches, improvements, and new      |
| implementations. New updates to the WebDevil system are multi-    |
| dimensional and as strong as the communities behind it. WebDevil, |
| by design, eliminates the centralization of webservers and web-   |
| services and puts power back into the freemarket and anyone with  |
| ideas to share. So if you're feeling bold enough to crack open    |
| a terminal, dot slash execute, and hack around in your favourite  |
| text-editor, then this piece of internet anarchy is for you.      |
|                                                                   |
|                                                                   |
