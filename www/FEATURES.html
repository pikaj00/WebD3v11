<b>FEATURES:</b>

    * WebDevil is decentralized, open source, free
      to use, free to modify, and holds no qualms
      about it. The git repository provides that
      new versions, new updates, and side channel
      additions are easily introduced though simple
      commits and pulls from various sources. This
      allows for WebDevil to grow dynamically
      unlike the most common, centralized webservers
      on the market. The repository allows users
      to opt in for redistribution, thus new dynamic
      additions and changes to the source code are
      readily available to those who want them.

    * Simple commandline launch and configuration.
      Anyone with common sense and a terminal can
      enjoy to use WebDevil.     

    * Multithreading for handling large amounts of
      client requests.

    * CGI support for whatever your system can
      handle. Just drop your scripts and executable
      code in the CGI directory, tell WebDevil where
      to look and WebDevil will execute. Bash, Python
      PHP, Perl, or any other language you prefer.
    
    * Optional Debugging Output for those looking
      for more testing and development and less
      spam according to preference.

    * Experimental multidaemon system. I've yet to
      see this system used elsewhere. WebDevil can
      optionally fork a user specified amount of
      WebImps, which divide the client requests in
      a sequential and even workload.

    * Minimal and legible Python code. This makes
      WebDevil easy to troubleshoot and modify
      if that's on your list to do.
